Q4:  I decided to use the hinted model architecture. Choosing the best architecture for a CNN is a difficult task. I tried altering some paramters like pool size, strides, and number of filters, but was unable to achieve better performance.  The architecture shown above makes use of three convolutional layers, each with a pooling layer, and increasing the number of filters each time. This has the effect of making the networkd 'deeper' while reducing the 'width' and 'length'. This gradual 'narrowing' and 'deepening' avoids bottlenecks and balances the width and depth, which is in line with the general advice given in a recent paper published by google (https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.00567)

Q6:  I decided to test the algorithm on a few pictures of my dog, Mollie.  Firstly, because I'm not sure exactly what breed she is (probably an American Bulldog) and secondly because I can test images of the same dog with different lighting, position, angles etc. and see how consistent the results are.
